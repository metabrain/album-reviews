### Elect The Dead - Serj Tankian (https://open.spotify.com/album/4AqwH2TDuW9P4KoIUXpU3G?si=TF6Z4unMTh2nWn1IV1NwzQ)

As good as it was back in 2007 - which is great. Not really SOAD, but very close in themes and pacing on some songs. Not sure if it is just because I listen to it a lot more when I was younger, but I still remember pretty much the lyrics to all the major singles in theis album. From Honking Antelope, Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition to Beethoven's Cunt and Unthinking Majority , all lyrics are unique in a very Serj way which I like a lot.

7/10
